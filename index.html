            <h1>Hello, World!!</h1>
            <p>I have just step into the world of web development so I thought I would make something
                as I go since I'm a beginner I assume that I make the dumbest sites. Here I will be posting the sites I
                make and if possible try to post some tutorials.
                This is kind of a blog page where a beginner post some stupid yet useful stuff :p.

                        <h2>Day 1</h2>
                        <p>So today I made a website inspired from dribbble from the concepts I learned so far.
                            And the website is not responsive
                            Here the main topic of concern is "float-clear" topic in CSS
                        </p>

                    <div class="listItem">
                        <h2>Day 2</h2>
                        <p>Today I made another website and learnt about FlexBox in CSS though I didn't master it or thouroughky
                            understand it.
                            I tried making something which is not that good again and this is also not responsive :(.
                            Topic covered : "Flexbox in CSS"

                        <h2>Day 4</h2>
                        <p>Today I thought of trying out javascript what I thought of making is a documentation page with
                            navigation which is dynamic.
                            I basically experimented with javascript DOM which was pretty good!. Have a look at the site I made!
                            :p

                            Today I just made a responsive navigation bar which I learnt from <a
                            target="blank"
                                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXkqy0b4M5g" style="color:red; font-weight: 500;">here</a>
