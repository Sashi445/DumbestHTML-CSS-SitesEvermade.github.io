                <p>I feel I'm the dumbest html css coder ever existed so I started to learn HTML-CSS.
                    So I've started this series of dumbest websites you would ever see on the internet.
                    Here I will be posting the websites as I go and parallely I will be learning git everyday I would update my progress here.
                    :).

                    <h3>Day 1: </h3>
                    <p>So today I made a website inspired from dribbble from the concepts I learned so far.
                        And the website is not responsive
                        Here the main topic of concern is "float-clear" topic in CSS
                    </p>
                    <p>Here goes the site : </p><a href="./sites/grow.html" target="#">Grow</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Day 2: </h3>
                    <p>Today I made another website and learnt about FlexBox in CSS though I didn't master it or thouroughky understand it.
                        I tried making something which is not that good again and this is also not responsive :(.
