                <h1>Hello, World!!</h1>
                <p>I have just step into the world of web development so I thought I would make something
                    as I go since I'm a beginner I assume that I make the dumbest sites. Here I will be posting the sites I make and if possible try to post some tutorials.
                    This is kind of a blog page where a beginner post some stupid yet useful stuff :p.
                </p>

                <a href="./sites/grow.html" target="#">
                    <div class="listItem">
                        <h2>Day 1</h2>
                        <p>So today I made a website inspired from dribbble from the concepts I learned so far.
                            And the website is not responsive
                            Here the main topic of concern is "float-clear" topic in CSS
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </a>
                <a href="./sites/travel_website.html" target="#">
                    <div class="listItem">
                        <h2>Day 2</h2>
                        <p>Today I made another website and learnt about FlexBox in CSS though I didn't master it or thouroughky understand it.
                            I tried making something which is not that good again and this is also not responsive :(.
                            Topic covered : "Flexbox in CSS"

                        <h2>Day 4</h2>
                        <p>Today I thought of trying out javascript what I thought of making is a documentation page with navigation which is dynamic.
                            I basically experimented with javascript DOM which was pretty good!. Have a look at the site I made! :p
